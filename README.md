# My neovim configuration ü§ó

#### To understand some of my settings, you may need to know that I use the following keymaps in the system

| Select       | To          | Commentary                                                                                                           |
|--------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CAPS         | ESC         | Game changer. Every vim user has to do this                                                                          |
| ALT          | CTRL        | Of course, I had to relearn CTRL + V, CTRL + C, CTRL + A, etc but it was worth it. But what about the alt? I did not change the left control to the alt. Instead, I use the right alt. It's more ergonomic because I don't have to leave homerow. So, I use the left alt as a control, and the right alt as the actual alt |
| CTRL + M     | CAPS        | Here and below, I press alt physically on the keyboard instead of ctrl because of the above keymaps                 |
| CTRL + TAB   | ALT + TAB   | ALT + TAB was the only combination where I used ALT key lol                                                          |
| CTRL + J     | ‚Üì           |                                                                                                                      |
| CTRL + K     | ‚Üë           |                                                                                                                      |
| CTRL + H     | ‚Üê           |                                                                                                                      |
| CTRL + L     | ‚Üí           |                                                                                                                      |
| CTRL + B     | CTRL + ‚Üê    |                                                                                                                      |
| CTRL + E     | CTRL + ‚Üí    |                                                                                                                      |
